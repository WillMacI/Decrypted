## Project Background
This project was made for the [Queen's Computing Orientation](https://qcomputingorientation.ca/) team in the Summer of 2024. Decrypted is a mystery game where participants break codes, solve puzzles, and piece together a story all in under an hour. In Decrypted's timeline the founder of the Queen's School of Computing has gone missing, it's your job to figure out what happened. Participants within their orientation groups try to solve the mystery together.

## Implementation
Originally this project was built to be ran in a browser. However due to the funds not being available for a web server that could handle the traffic and computation needed to run the event coupled with the universities slow network infastructure I decided to make it a standalone Electron app.
